# Enhanced Wedding Invitation Generator - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the enhanced requirements for transforming our existing Goan Wedding Invitation Generator into a comprehensive, competitive wedding invitation platform. Building on our current system, we will implement modern UX patterns, advanced customization features, and multi-format capabilities to compete with platforms like WedMeGood while maintaining our no-login, privacy-first approach.

## Current System Context

- **Existing Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript frontend, Express.js backend, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Current Features**: Canvas-based invitation generation, QR code support, 24-hour token expiration
- **Template System**: Single floral template with hardcoded positioning
- **Files to Enhance**: 
  - Frontend: `client/src/pages/InvitationGenerator.tsx`
  - Backend: `server/invitationGenerator.ts`, `server/simpleInvitationGenerator.ts`
