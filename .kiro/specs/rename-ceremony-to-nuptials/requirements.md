# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves systematically renaming all instances of "ceremony time" to "nuptials time" throughout the application. This includes form field labels, state variables, database fields, API responses, and user-facing text to maintain consistency in terminology.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user filling out wedding forms, I want to see "nuptials time" instead of "ceremony time" in form labels, so that the terminology is consistent with the updated branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any form with time fields THEN the label SHALL display "nuptials time" instead of "ceremony time"
2. WHEN examining form components THEN all JSX labels SHALL use "nuptials time" terminology
3. WHEN forms are rendered THEN placeholder text SHALL reflect "nuptials time" where applicable
4. WHEN form validation messages appear THEN they SHALL reference "nuptials time" terminology

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with the codebase, I want all state variables and component props to use "nuptials time" naming, so that the code is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing component state THEN all variables SHALL use "nuptialsTime" naming convention
2. WHEN examining component props THEN all ceremony time related props SHALL be renamed to "nuptialsTime"
3. WHEN TypeScript interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL use "nuptialsTime" property names
4. WHEN function parameters reference ceremony time THEN they SHALL use "nuptialsTime" naming

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing wedding information, I want all displayed text to show "nuptials time" instead of "ceremony time", so that the terminology is consistent across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing wedding details THEN all text SHALL display "nuptials time" instead of "ceremony time"
2. WHEN reading wedding invitations THEN the time reference SHALL use "nuptials time" terminology
3. WHEN viewing RSVP information THEN time-related text SHALL use "nuptials time"
4. WHEN examining any user-facing content THEN "ceremony time" SHALL not appear anywhere

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want database fields and API responses to use "nuptials time" terminology, so that the data layer is consistent with the user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database schemas are examined THEN ceremony time fields SHALL be renamed to "nuptials_time"
2. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL use "nuptialsTime" in JSON properties
3. WHEN database migrations are run THEN existing "ceremony_time" columns SHALL be renamed
4. WHEN API documentation is reviewed THEN it SHALL reflect "nuptialsTime" field names
