# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature expands the automated testing infrastructure beyond the RSVP flow to provide comprehensive test coverage for all major application functionality. Building on the successful RSVP testing framework, this expansion will ensure robust testing for vendor management, guest wishlists, blog content management, business submissions, and UI components. The goal is to establish a complete testing suite that validates both backend API operations and frontend component behavior, ensuring application reliability and preventing regressions.

7. WHEN testing notification workflows THEN the system SHALL send appropriate emails for status changes and updates

### Requirement 5: UI Component Snapshot Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated UI regression testing, so that I can detect unintended visual changes and maintain consistent user interface design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering vendor listing components THEN the system SHALL capture and compare visual snapshots
2. WHEN displaying RSVP forms THEN the system SHALL validate component structure and styling consistency
3. WHEN showing blog card components THEN the system SHALL ensure proper layout and content presentation
4. WHEN testing responsive design elements THEN the system SHALL validate components across different screen sizes
5. WHEN updating component props THEN the system SHALL detect and flag unexpected visual changes
6. WHEN managing snapshot updates THEN the system SHALL provide clear processes for intentional UI changes
7. WHEN testing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL validate hover states, focus indicators, and accessibility features

### Requirement 6: Integration Testing for Cross-Feature Workflows

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless integration between different platform features, so that I can have a cohesive experience across vendor browsing, wishlist management, and content consumption.
