npm run test:integration
node scripts/production-tests.js

# 2. Build production assets
npm run build

# 3. Database migrations (if needed)
npm run db:migrate

# 4. Backup current production (if updating)
# Follow your backup procedures
```

### 2. Deployment
```bash
# Option A: Automated deployment via GitHub Actions
git push origin main

# Option B: Manual deployment
npm run deploy:production

## Rollback Procedures

### üö® When to Rollback
- Critical functionality broken
- Error rate > 5%
- Performance degradation > 50%
- Security vulnerability detected
- Database corruption

### üîÑ Rollback Steps

#### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Revert to previous deployment
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# 2. Or use deployment platform rollback
# Vercel: vercel --prod --rollback
# Heroku: heroku rollback
# Docker: docker run previous-image-tag
```

#### Database Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# 1. Stop application
systemctl stop wedding-app

# 2. Restore database backup
pg_restore -d wedding_db backup_file.sql

# 3. Revert database migrations
npm run db:rollback

# 4. Start application with previous version
systemctl start wedding-app
```

#### Full System Rollback
```bash
# 1. Switch to maintenance mode
echo "Maintenance mode enabled" > public/maintenance.html

# 2. Restore full system backup
# Follow your backup restoration procedures

# 3. Verify system integrity
node scripts/production-tests.js

# 4. Disable maintenance mode
rm public/maintenance.html
```

### üìã Post-Rollback Actions
- [ ] Verify all systems operational
- [ ] Check error rates normalized
- [ ] Confirm user experience restored
- [ ] Document incident and root cause
- [ ] Plan fix for next deployment
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of resolution
