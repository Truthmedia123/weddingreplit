It looks like the category cards are still rendering empty placeholders because no <svg> elements are making it into the DOM. Even though your mapping function is in place, the fact that you’re still seeing spaces means that IconComponent = LucideIcons[iconName] is resolving to undefined (or a non-component) at render time. Here’s a step-by-step checklist to diagnose and fix the issue:

1. Verify that the exact string coming from the API matches an export name in lucide-react.

In your category card component, temporarily add:

tsx
console.log('Icon field:', icon, '→ Component:', LucideIcons[icon]);
Reload the page and check the browser console. If you see undefined, you know the names don’t match exactly (including case).

2. Normalize and map incoming strings to actual component names.

If your API returns "partyPopper" or "party-popper" instead of "PartyPopper", transform it:

ts
const normalize = (str: string) =>
  str
    .replace(/[-_]/g, ' ')
    .split(' ')
    .map(w => w.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + w.slice(1))
    .join('');
const componentName = normalize(iconField);
const IconComponent = LucideIcons[componentName];
3. Implement a robust fallback.

If IconComponent is still falsy, render a known default icon so you can detect mis-matches visually:

tsx
import { File } from 'lucide-react';
…
{IconComponent
  ? <IconComponent size={32} />
  : <File size={32} className="text-gray-400" />}
4. Ensure tree-shaking isn’t stripping imports.

Rather than importing all icons at once (import * as LucideIcons), consider explicitly importing the ones you need at the top of your file:

tsx
import { PartyPopper, Music, Wine, File } from 'lucide-react';
const iconMap = { PartyPopper, Music, Wine };
Then look up in that map:

tsx
const IconComponent = iconMap[componentName] || File;
5. Clear Vite’s HMR cache and hard-reload.

Run npm run dev -- --force or shift-reload in the browser to ensure no stale bundle remains.

Once you see actual <svg> elements in the DOM (you can verify via “Inspect Element”), the icons will appear. If you still get blanks, confirm that your card JSX is indeed rendering the IconComponent in the correct location—and not accidentally behind a CSS rule like visibility: hidden or font-size: 0.
