1. Design & User Experience
Adopt a Consistent Design System

Define a color palette inspired by Goa’s landscape (ocean-blue, palm-green, sunset-orange) and apply it consistently to buttons, links, headings, and background elements.

Use a single webfont pairing (e.g., a serif for headings and a sans-serif for body text) to improve readability and visual hierarchy.

Enhance Responsiveness

Implement a mobile-first CSS approach with flexible grid or CSS Flexbox for vendor cards and content sections.

Ensure touch targets (buttons, links) are at least 44×44 px per WCAG guidelines.

Polish Visuals

Replace placeholder images with optimized, high-resolution Goa wedding photos and serve them via <picture> with WebP fallbacks.

Add subtle micro-interactions (hover states, button ripples) using CSS transitions to make the UI feel interactive.

2. Content Strategy & SEO
Improve On-Page SEO

Write unique, keyword-rich <title> tags and meta descriptions for each page (e.g., “Top Goa Beach Wedding Photographers | WeddingVendorHub”).

Structure headings (H1–H3) hierarchically: H1 for page title, H2 for major sections (Venues, Catering), H3 for sublists.

Add alt attributes to images with descriptive text (e.g., “Goa beachfront mandap setup”).

Expand & Organize Content

Break long vendor lists into categorized pages (e.g., “Venues,” “Photography,” “Catering”) and link via a clear navigation menu.

Include 150–200-word vendor profiles with local insights, and display ratings or testimonials to build trust.

Create a blog section covering local tips (“Best Monsoon Wedding Venues in Goa,” “Top Goan Wedding Traditions”) to target long-tail keywords.

Implement Structured Data

Use JSON-LD Schema.org markup for local business and reviews on each vendor profile to enhance SERP features.

3. Performance Optimization
Asset Optimization

Compress and lazy-load images with loading="lazy" and serve responsive sizes via <picture>.

Minify CSS and JavaScript; combine smaller files to reduce HTTP requests.

Leverage Modern Web Practices

Use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 if supported by your hosting for multiplexed requests.

Preload critical CSS and defer nonessential scripts to prevent render-blocking.

Audit & Monitor

Run Lighthouse audits and aim for >90 scores in Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices; address flagged issues promptly.

4. Functionality & Interactivity
Client-Side Filtering & Search

Implement JavaScript-based filters (budget, category, availability) so users can refine results without page reloads.

Add a live search input with debounced queries to filter vendors as the user types.

Interactive Map Integration

Embed a Leaflet.js map showing vendor locations around key Goan areas (Panaji, Baga, Anjuna), with clickable markers displaying vendor snippets.

Contact & Inquiry Forms

Integrate a dynamic contact form (e.g., using Formspree or a serverless function) that captures date, guest count, and budget, then emails you automatically.

5. Accessibility & Compliance
Ensure Keyboard Navigation

Verify that all interactive elements (menus, buttons, forms) are reachable and operable via keyboard alone.

Improve Contrast & Readability

Use contrast-checker tools to ensure text meets a minimum 4.5:1 ratio against background colors.

ARIA & Semantic HTML

Add appropriate ARIA roles (e.g., role="navigation" for nav bars) and landmarks (<main>, <aside>) to aid screen readers.
