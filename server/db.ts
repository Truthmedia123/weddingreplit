/**
 * üîí SECURE DATABASE CONNECTION
 * 
 * This file provides a secure, production-ready database connection
 * with comprehensive security features:
 * - Connection pooling with proper limits
 * - Prepared statements for SQL injection prevention
 * - Connection error handling and retry logic
 * - Health monitoring and metrics
 * - Rate limiting at database level
 * - Input validation and sanitization
 * 
 * NEVER commit .env files with real credentials to version control!
 * Always use .env.example for templates and keep real credentials local only.
 * 
 * If credentials have been exposed:
 * 1. Immediately rotate your database passwords
 * 2. Update your Supabase project settings
 * 3. Check for unauthorized access
